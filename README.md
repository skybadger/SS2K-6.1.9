This projec implements an ASCOM (ASCOM.org) Vixen SkySensor 2000 Telescope controller driver. 
The key feature this driver adds adds to the original source code (Laurie code) is the spoofing of the ability to set the current tracking rate. 
This is essential if you want to be able to use wireless games controllers with the telescope controller , typically using the ASCOMPAD component of EQASCOM.
